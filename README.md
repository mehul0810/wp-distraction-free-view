 ## üôã Support
 
 This repository is not suitable for support. Please don't use GitHub issues for non-development related support requests. Don't get us wrong, we're more than happy to help you! However, to get the support you need please use the following channels:

* [WP.org Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-distraction-free-view) - for all **free** users.
* [Documentation](https://mehulgohil.com/contact) - for all **admins** (coming soon). 
 
## üå± Getting Started 

If you're looking to contribute or actively develop on the plugin, Welcome! We're glad you're here. Please ‚≠êÔ∏è this repository and fork it to begin local development. 

Most of us are using [Local by Flywheel](https://localbyflywheel.com/) to develop on WordPress, which makes set up quick and easy. If you prefer [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [VVV](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV), or another flavor of local development that's cool too!

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as JavaScript engine
* [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/) npm command globally available in CLI

## üíª Local Development 

To get started developing on the WP Distraction Free View, you will need to perform the following steps:

1. Create a new WordPress site with any URL
2. `cd` into your local plugins directory: `/path/to/wp-content/plugins/`
3. Fork this repository from GitHub and then clone that into your plugins directory in a new `wp-distraction-free-view` directory
4. Run `npm install` to get the necessary npm packages
5. Activate the plugin in WordPress
6. Run `npm run watch` to start the watch process which will build the sass and script files  

That's it. You're now ready to start development.

**Available commands**

| Command             | Description  |
| :------------- | :------------ |
| `npm run watch`      | Live reloads JS and SASS files. Typically you'll run this command before you start development. It's necessary to build the JS/CSS however if you're working strictly within PHP it may not be necessary to run.  |
| `npm run dev`      |    Runs a one time build for development. No production files are created. |
| `npm run production` |  Builds the minified production files for release. |

**Development Notes**

* Ensure that you have `SCRIPT_DEBUG` enabled within your wp-config.php file. Here's a good example of wp-config.php for debugging:
    ```
     // Enable WP_DEBUG mode
    define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );
    
    // Enable Debug logging to the /wp-content/debug.log file
    define( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true );
   
    // Loads unminified core files
    define( 'SCRIPT_DEBUG', true );
    ```
* Commit the `package.lock` file. Read more about why [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-lock.json). 
* Your editor should recognize the `.eslintrc` and `.editorconfig` files within the Repo's root directory. Please only submit PRs following those coding style rulesets.
